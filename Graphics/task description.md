# 📸 Task: Create Professional App Store Screenshot Story for *Three Daily Goals*

## 🧭 About the App
**Three Daily Goals (3DG)** is a calm, minimalist task manager for **macOS**, **iPadOS**, and **iOS**.

It’s designed for people who feel overwhelmed by endless to-do lists — helping them focus on *what truly matters each day*.  
Instead of juggling hundreds of tasks, users set **three goals per day** and review their progress through a short reflection process called a **Compass Check**.

Learn more about the philosophy and color style at [https://threedailygoals.com](https://threedailygoals.com).

Main colors: **white**, **black**, and **soft orange** accents (the app itself uses system colors for task states).

## 🎯 What I Need
I’m looking for **a full package of professional App Store screenshots** that tell a story across:
- macOS  
- iPadOS  
- iOS  

Each platform uses the same core design and story — only the layout differs.  
The visuals should also be reusable on my **website**, where they flow together as a unified story across all three platforms.

## 🖼️ Story Flow
The goal is a calm, focused journey through the app, showing continuity across all platforms:

1. **Find focus again.**  
   *Streak + List overview — introduce simplicity and calm.*
2. **Choose your three goals for today.**  
   *Compass Check start — show intention and clarity.*
3. **Stay on track with your daily streak.**  
   *Highlight the gamification element.*
4. **See just the tasks that deserve your energy.**  
   *List filtering / state-based access.*
5. **Add tasks, files, and notes effortlessly.**  
   *Task detail view — clean and uncluttered.*
6. **Review progress and let go of what no longer matters.**  
   *Compass review step — reflection and release.*
7. **Collect tasks instantly from anywhere.**  
   *Show the app’s Share Extension (adding a task from another app like Safari or Mail).*
8. *(Optional, coming soon)* **End your day clear and ready for tomorrow.**  
   *Future “Plan the next day” view.*

- Light backgrounds, **soft orange highlights**, and **Apple-style typography**.

- Tone: **soothing and supportive**, not “hustle culture.”
