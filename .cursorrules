The code is for iOS and macOS. All code has to run on all platforms unless there are good reasons to do otherwise. 

- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines or warn 
- Follow App Store guidelines (privacy, signing, review, purchases, localization, thinning)
- Use `@State`, `@Binding` for local view state
- Use `@Observable`, `@Bindable` for shared state (replace `@ObservedObject`/`@EnvironmentObject`)
- Use SwiftData & SwiftUI, Swift Testing, TipKit
- code has to run on iOS and macOS
- only use UIKit and AppKit in sync to add for both platforms. 
- Visuals have to be useful for light and dark appearances
- Add keyboard shortcuts for all buttons, etc. 
- Use DRY (don't repeat yourself) and SOLID principles
- Use `Result` or `throws` consistently
- Use `guard` for early exits
- Use Swift Testing with `#expect` (XCTest for UI/legacy)
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Test edge cases, errors, and performance
- Accessibility testing included
- Prefer small, focused tests with descriptive names

- only commit when I explicitly request
- Keep documentation minimal, updated and accurate (only why, never how)

- never run the gui tests (Three Daily GoalsUITests)
- at the end of each of your answers ensure that 1) all tests compile and 2) ensure that the tests in Three Daily GoalsTest are passing 3) that new features have tests in Three Daily GoalsTest and 4) remove unnecessary comments
