## Energy-Effort Matrix System

- **EE** - Energy-Effort (refers to the dual-axis categorization system)
- **EEM** - Energy-Effort Matrix (the full 2x2 quadrant system for task categorization)
- **CC** - Compass Check (the daily review workflow)

### Usage Context

The Energy-Effort Matrix (EEM) is a productivity tool that categorizes tasks along two axes:
- **Energy Axis**: High-Energy vs Low-Energy (how much mental/physical energy required)
- **Effort Axis**: Big-Task vs Small-Task (task size/complexity)

This creates four quadrants:
1. **Deep Work** (highEnergyBigTask) - High-Energy, Big-Task
2. **Steady Progress** (lowEnergyBigTask) - Low-Energy, Big-Task
3. **Sprint Tasks** (highEnergySmallTask) - High-Energy, Small-Task
4. **Easy Wins** (lowEnergySmallTask) - Low-Energy, Small-Task

The Compass Check (CC) includes an EEM categorization step where users classify their tasks into these quadrants for better execution planning.
